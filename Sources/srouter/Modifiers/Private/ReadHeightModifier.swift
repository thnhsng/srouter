/// A preference key used to store and read the height of a view in SwiftUI.
///
/// `HeightPreferenceKey` is a custom `PreferenceKey` that allows the height of a view to be captured
/// and passed to other views or used within the view hierarchy. This is useful for layouts where
/// you need to dynamically adjust based on the size of a child view.
///
/// The key aggregates multiple height values by taking the maximum height encountered,
/// which can be useful when dealing with stacks or other layouts where multiple views' heights
/// need to be considered.
///
/// - Default Value: The default value for this key is `0`, representing no height.
struct HeightPreferenceKey: PreferenceKey {

    /// The default value for the preference key, which is `0`. This represents the initial height
    /// before any actual value is read from the view.

    /// Combines multiple values by taking the maximum height encountered.
    /// This method is called for each new value, allowing you to aggregate values from multiple
    /// views if necessary.

    /// - Parameters:
    ///   - value: The current accumulated value of height.
    ///   - nextValue: A closure that returns the next value in the sequence.

/// `ReadHeightModifier` is a custom `ViewModifier` that captures the height of a view by
/// embedding a `GeometryReader` within the view's background. The height is then stored
/// in a preference key, which can be accessed by other views in the view hierarchy.
///
/// This modifier is useful for scenarios where you need to know the size of a view at runtime,
/// such as for adjusting layout or performing custom animations based on view size.

/// allowing you to execute a closure with the captured height value. This makes it easy to react
/// to changes in a view's height and use that information to adjust your UI accordingly.

 Example usage of `HeightPreferenceKey` and `ReadHeightModifier` in a SwiftUI view:

 ```swift
 struct ContentView: View {

     /// State variable to store the height of the text view.
     @State private var height: CGFloat = 0

     var body: some View {
         VStack {
             /// A text view that reads its height and updates the `height` state variable.
             Text("Hello, SwiftUI!")
                 .readHeight { newHeight in
                    self.height = newHeight
                 }

         /// A text view that displays the current height of the previous text view.
         Text("Height: \(height)")
         }
     }
 }
